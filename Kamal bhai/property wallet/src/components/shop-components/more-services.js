        The inventory management option on our app enables you to:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Add a project with the specified information; including name of the
            builder and project, its location, categories, sizes, prices and,
            most importantly, if its NOC has been approved. A project can also
            be eliminated.
          </li>

          <li>
            Give staff members instructions while assigning or removing
            projects.
          </li>

          <li>
            Eliminate a property from inventory when sold out, figure out the
            commission and revenue, and choose whether to accept a full cash
            payment or a down payment.

            The staff management feature has 3 kinds of accesses. The agency
            owner (super admin) will have access to everything. He/She will be
            able to add, delete, or update staff, communicate with their team,
            and monitor all commission and revenue including any leads
            generated. The manager(admin), on the other hand, has access to
            their team, monitoring their commissions and revenue generated from
            each. Additionally, they can add or distribute leads among the
            employees, and can contact the agency owner and staff. The staff has
            access to add leads, inspect inventory, and add booking requests for
            projects, but they can communicate only with the manager.
          </li>

          <li>
            New employees can be added with their names, phone numbers, emails,
            CNIC, addresses, and salaries. They can also be deleted, when
            needed.
          </li>

          <li>
            To share media or inventory, managers and admins can communicate via
            chat.
          </li>
          <li>
            Acquire monthly reports on the agency's overall sales. This includes
            sales for each project, sales by each manager and staff, total
            income brought in, and total profit earned.

            Set manager's and staff's commission rates according to each
            category's sales.

          <li>
            Get to know your companyâ€™s overall profit. It can be sought by
            subtracting the amount of commission that is paid out to the staff
            and managers from the total amount of commission earned from each
            sale.
          </li>

          <li>
            Keep records of the commissions paid to the agents as well as the
            property they sold. This can also let you know the amount of money
